## About Me

I am a political science PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I work on methods that mix some combination of Bayesian modeling, causal inference, and (sometimes, increasingly, getting there) machine learning.
I use these tools to study U.S. public opinion, voting, and election administration.
