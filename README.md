## Michael DeCrescenzo (@mikedecr)

I do quantitative research and research platform development at a trading firm in Chicago.

I used to be a political scientist.
I built Bayesian models for measurement and causal inference, applying these to U.S. electoral competition, the "latent ideological structure" of partisan public opinion, election policy changes, and so on.

I work primarily with Python code lately.
I used to write a lot of R in graduate school.
I am trying to get more familiar with Julia and OCaml.

This Github profile contains some extracurricular projects, archives of some academic and instructional materials, and configurations for managing my digital life.

Some highlights:

- [Advent of Code](https://github.com/mikedecr/aoc) solutions
- An archive of [blog posts](https://github.com/mikedecr/blog-monorepo) and the [website](https://github.com/mikedecr/site-hugo) where they live
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/mikedecr/dots) and [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/mikedecr/nvim)
- Keyboard configurations: [qmk](https://github.com/mikedecr/qmk_firmware) for device firmware and [Karabiner](https://github.com/mikedecr/karabiner_config) for modifying MacOS's handling of device inputs
- Silly incomplete R packages: [prefix](https://github.com/mikedecr/prefix) and [currr](https://github.com/mikedecr/currr). (I do not recommend installing these... they are proof-of-concept more than anything)
- my, uhhh..., [dissertation](https://github.com/mikedecr/dissertation) repo
