## Michael DeCrescenzo (@mikedecr)

I am a quantitative researcher working in high-frequency trading.
I use statistics, machine learning, and other high-powered computing tools to analyze financial markets and develop trading strategies that go very fast.

I hold a PhD in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I worked on Bayesian modeling for measurement and causal inference to study U.S. elections and public opinion.
