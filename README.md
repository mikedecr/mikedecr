## About Me

I am a quantitative researcher at DRW Holdings, which means I do statistical modeling of financial market data.
My expertise is in Bayesian methods for generative and predictive modeling.

I hold a PhD in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. 
My political science work combines Bayesian modeling and causal inference to study elections and public opinion in the United States, with projects on congressional primary elections, the gender voting gap, voter identification requirements, and the communication of polls and election forecasts.
