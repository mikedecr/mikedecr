I do statistics & software development in high-frequency trading.

This site contains:

- extracurricular projects (website, blog posts...)
- archives of open-souce graduate work (I have a PhD in political science)
- notes + code for courses I taught in the past
- text-based config files and other helpful scripts for managing my digital life
