## Michael DeCrescenzo (@mikedecr)

I am a quantitative researcher working in finance.
I use statistics, machine learning, and other high-powered computing tools to develop trading strategies that go very fast.

This site contains:

- archives of open-souce graduate work (I have a PhD in political science)
- notes/code for courses I used to teach
- text-based config files and other helpful scripts for managing my digital life
- other fun extracurricular projects
