## About Me

I am a political science PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I study quantitative methods and U.S. politics. 

I work on methods that mix some combination of Bayesian modeling, causal inference, and (sometimes, increasingly, getting there) machine learning.
I use these tools to study U.S. public opinion, voting, and election administration.

Academic-focused methodology projects focus on Bayesian applications of...

- Generative modeling: measurement error approches for aggregated surveyd data, IRT models for political ideology, joint structural modeling of survey responses. 
- Causal modeling: priors as statistical assumptions, fuzzy identification assumptions, implied probability density over potential outcomes.
- Machine learning for causal inference: prior-induced confounding, joint modeling of split samples, subposterior merging. 

Projects have substantive focus on...

- Aggregate responsiveness of congressional candidates to voters' policy preferences in primaries (dissertation)
- Modeling and understanding group dynamics in electoral coalitions
- Voter identification requirements and voter confusion in election law
- Communicating uncertainty in journalistic coverage of polls and election forecasts
